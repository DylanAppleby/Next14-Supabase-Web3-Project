            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to

            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this

            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and

            any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards

            over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
            hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment.
